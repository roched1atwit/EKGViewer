                    <p> 
                        The first step in preparing a patient for EKG monitoring is
                        to prep the patient. Some of the steps listed below may seem
                        obvious or straight forward, but they nevertheless are important.
                    </p>                
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Confirm the patient's identity.</b> This step is crucial to any
                            medical procedure. Make sure you have the correct patient
                            before administering the EKG.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Explain the procedure to the patient.</b> This is essential
                            regardless of the medical treatment you are going to provide. 
                            Every pateint should be able to make informed decisions 
                            regarding their medical treatment. It is your job to make 
                            sure they understand the goal of any proposed treatment as well 
                            as the risks associated with it. This is also a great opportunity
                            to establish a rapport with your patient to help them feel 
                            comfortable working with you.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Finally, obtain patient consent. </b>Now that you have fully explained
                            the procedure to the patient, the last step is to gain their
                            permission to administer the EKG.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Set the room to a comfortably warm temperature.</b> This will prevent 
                            muscular tension or movements which will produce artifacts on the EKG
                            recording.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Give the patient privacy.</b> Their chest will be exposed to place the EKG
                            leads. So close the door to their room or draw the curtains around
                            their bed in order to respect their privacy.
                        <li>
                            <b>Remove any jewelry.</b> The metal can interfere with the electric signals in the 
                            EKG and create artifiacts on the EKG recording.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Wash your hands.</b>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Place the patient in a relaxed, supine position.</b> A supine position is
                            the opposite of prone, meaning the patient is lying flat on their back with their
                            head and chest facing upwards towards the ceiling. All limbs should be supported
                            and their chest should be exposed. No muscular work should be required by the 
                            patient to maintain their position and posture.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Prepare the patient's skin.</b> Their chest should be cleaned with soap and
                            water. Additionally, if the patient has chest hair, it should be removed before
                            the EKG leads are applied. The goal is to have the leads placed cleanly on the skin 
                            with no other debris in between.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        After you have completed each one of these steps, you may begin to administer the EKG to 
                        the patient.

                        The method below is the most common way to place EKG leads. It is known
                        as the 12 Lead EKG Angle of Louis Method. Placing the leads to an EKG does
                        require some medical knowledge, specifically knowing how to find intercostal
                        spaces, some body lines, and the Angle of Louis.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>V1:</b>Locate the sternal notch Angle of Louie at the second rib. Fil down
                            to the 4th intercostal space. V1 is placed to the right of the sternal border.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>V2:</b>Follow the same procedure as V1 to the 4th intercostal space. Place
                            V2 to the left of the sternal border, opposite V1.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>V4:</b> Place V4 before V3. V4 should be placed on the patient's
                            left side, in the 5th intercostal space, on the midclavicular line. The midclavicular
                            line is an imaginary line perpendicular to the middle of the patient's clavicle.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>V3:</b> Place V3 directly between V2 and V4.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>V6:</b>Placed over the 5th intercostal space at the mid axillary line. The mid axillary
                                line is an imaginary line down the middle of the arm pit.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>V5:</b> Place V5 directly between V4 and V6. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>RA:</b>Right arm. Place anywhere from the shoulder to the wrist.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>LA:</b>Left arm. Place symmetrically to RA.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>RL:</b>Right leg. Place anywhere from the ankle to upper thigh.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>LA:</b>Left leg. Place symmetrically to RL.
                        </li>
