                    <li><b>Late 1700's</b> - the first step in the development of the modern electrocardiograph machine was the creation of the machine that could sense, electric current. This was called the a galvanometer.</li>
                    <li><b>1786</b> - Dr. Luigi Galvan, an Italian physician, discovered that skeletal muslces worled by producing electric current.</li>
                    <li><b>1842</b> - Dr. Carlo Matteucci discovered that there is a electrical current that comes with each heart beat in a frog.</li>
                    <li><b>Mid 1800's</b> - The Rheotome, a machine to measure electrical current, was inveted.</li>
                    <li><b>1872</b> - Gabrilled Lippman devised the capillary electrometer, an improved Rheotome. August Waller was able to record the first human electrocardiogram.</li>
                    <li><b>1893</b> - Dr. Wilhelm Einthoven refined the capillary electrometer to show five deflections in the elecctrical current passing through the heart. The term "electrocardiogram" is used for the first time.</li>
                    <li><b>1901</b> - Dr. Eintoven develops the string galvanometer. He was awared the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology for the electrocardiograph</li>
